<h1 align="center">Birthdate Palindrome Check</h1>

Birthdate Palindrome Check is a fun game app created using Vanilla JS, which tells users whether their birthdate is palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word/number which reads the same backward as forward. This app checks your birthdate in 4 formats yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yy, m-dd-yyyy.

### How it works?

- Takes user's birthday
- Tells them whether they was born on a palindrome day or not. 
- Users can put dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY format etc. to check if they have any chance. 
- If not a palindrome, then it tells users what is the nearest date from their birthdate which is a palindrome date. 
-  It also tells them by how many days they missed it.
